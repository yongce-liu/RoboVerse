# Custom Extra Observations in MetaSim (`get_extra`)

## Design Philosophy

By default, MetaSim (RoboVerse) provides standard observations such as robot joint states, velocities, and camera images. However, there are situations when you might need specific data that is **not directly included in RoboVerse's default state**. 

Extra Observation system is a way to inject user-defined observation queries into handlers without modifying the handler class itself.

## Architecture

A custom Extra Observation type is defined by inheriting `metasim.queries.base.BaseQueryType` . Let's call the inherited class `extra_qeury`.

This class has only one important method you need to overwrite **__call__()** .

When an Extra Observation is used by a Task, it will be automatically bound to the underlying handler. You can then use `self.handler` to access the handler instance within the Extra Observation class.

Everytime the `handler.get_state()` is called, the handler will call the `extra_qeury.__call__()` method of the Extra Observation type, to gather the extra observations, and return them in the return value of `handler.get_state()` . When calling `handler.get_extra()`, the handler will also be explicitly called adn the extra observations will be gathered and returned.

## Possible Extra Observations

Extra Observations includes:

* Positions or velocities of specific bodies or objects.
* Sensor readings like IMU data.
* World-frame poses of specific simulation geometry (e.g., sites, bodies, frames).
* Any other types you encounter...

## Workflow for Using Extra Observations in Tasks

Adding custom extra observations follows these steps:

1. **Declare** the extra observations you need inside your **TaskEnv.extra_spec**.
2. **Pass** these extras to your simulation **Handler**.
3. The Handler automatically **binds** these extras, linking them to your simulation instance.
4. You then implement the procedure to access the custom data at runtime inside `extra_qeury.__call__()`. `handler.get_states()` will use `extra_qeury.__call__()` to attain extras infomation in states.

Simplified workflow diagram:

```
Task declares extras ──> Handler binds extras ──> Retrieve extras at runtime
```

## Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### Step 1: Declare Extras in Your Task

Implement the `_extra_spec` method inside your task definition:

```python
def _extra_spec(self) -> dict:
    return {
        "imu_pos": SitePos("imu"),   # World position of IMU sensor site
        "head_vel": BodyVel("head"), # Velocity of the robot's head
    }
```

* The **keys** (e.g., `"imu_pos"`) are user-defined and identify the returned data.
* The **values** (`SitePos`, `BodyVel`) are pre-defined QueryTypes that fetch specific data from your simulator.

Common built-in queries:

* `SitePos("site_name")`: Returns world-frame position.
* `BodyVel("body_name")`: Returns velocity of a body.

### Step 2: Pass Extras to the Handler

When creating your simulation Handler, pass your extras dictionary (`_extra_spec`) via the `optional_queries` parameter:

```python
task = CrawlEnv(CrawlEnv.scenario)
extra_queries = task._extra_spec()

handler = YourSimHandler(
    scenario=task.scenario,
    optional_queries=extra_queries
)

handler.launch()  # Extras get bound here
```

---

### Step 3: Access Extra Observations at Runtime

While your simulation is running, simply call:

```python
extras = handler.get_extra()
```

This returns a dictionary containing your custom observations:

```python
{
    "imu_pos": tensor([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [...]]),
    "head_vel": tensor([[0.01, 0.02, 0.03], [...]])
}
```

You can directly use this data for:

* Reward computations
* Logging and analysis
* Visualization purposes

Additionally, when you call:

```python
state = handler.get_state()
```

the returned `state` dictionary **automatically includes all the extra observations you've defined**. This way, your extras seamlessly integrate into RoboVerse's default simulation state.

## Adding Your Own Custom Query

If the existing queries in MetaSim do not fit your needs, you can define a custom query type by subclassing `BaseQueryType`.

Each custom query involves two steps:

### ① Define a subclass of `BaseQueryType`

First, create a new Python class that inherits from `BaseQueryType`. You will typically implement two methods in this class:

* **`bind_handler(self, handler)`**:
  This method is called **once** when the simulation launches. Here you save necessary references (such as simulator handles, indexes, IDs, or configurations) from your specific simulation handler.

* **`__call__(self)`**:
  This method is invoked **at runtime** every time you request extras. In this method, you use the previously stored references to retrieve the real-time data you need.

Example:

```python
from metasim.queries.base import BaseQueryType
import torch

class BodyMassQuery(BaseQueryType):
    def bind_handler(self, handler):
        # Store the handler for later use
        self.handler = handler

        # Example: simulator-specific logic
        mod = handler.__class__.__module__
        if mod.startswith("metasim.sim.mujoco"):
            self.mass = handler.physics.model.body_mass  # Example MuJoCo API call
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported handler: {mod}")

    def __call__(self):
        # Return the stored body mass as a tensor
        return torch.tensor(self.mass)
```

### ② Use your custom query inside `_extra_spec`

After defining your custom query class, simply instantiate and use it directly in your task's `_extra_spec` method:

```python
def _extra_spec(self) -> dict:
    return {
        "body_mass": BodyMassQuery(), # Your custom query
        "imu_pos": SitePos("imu"),
    }
```

After following these steps, your handler will automatically bind your custom query, and you can seamlessly retrieve this data during runtime.

---

## Practical Tips

* **Always ensure** simulator-specific code in your custom query is correctly placed inside the `bind_handler` method. This ensures efficient performance, as binding happens once at simulation launch rather than repeatedly at runtime.

* Your `__call__` method should be fast and efficient, simply retrieving pre-stored references or quickly fetching real-time data.

* It’s good practice to return data consistently as PyTorch tensors (or similarly structured arrays), as these integrate well with downstream RL pipelines.

Now you're fully equipped to flexibly extend your RoboVerse simulation with any custom extra observations you need!
