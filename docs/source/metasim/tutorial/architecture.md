# RoboVerse Project Architecture

## Overview

RoboVerse is a unified framework for robotic simulation and learning. It spans from multi-simulator abstraction, task systems, and scenario management to reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) modules. The design goal is to provide a highly modular, reusable, and extensible ecosystem that allows researchers and developers to quickly build, migrate, and evaluate diverse robotic learning tasks.

In Metasim, we followed the principles of object oriented programming, and used wrapper + hook framework to keep the logic clear and make the framework extendable. We proposed 4 layers of simulations defined in the following figure.

From the core to the shell, we have `Handlers`, whose responsibility is to run the physics simulation with different backends, `Task Wrappers`, who constructs the Gym-like pipeline, `Domain Randomizer`, who plays an improtant role in creating randomized simulation, and `RL Env Wrapper`, which can be added to further specify which observations are used for RL trainings.

**Handlers in metasim**: All static contents of a simulation (robots used, objects used, lightings, physics parameters) are defined inside of a configuration system we call `Scenario Config`. Such configs are then instantiated with `Handlers` with different backends (mujoco, isaaclab, etc.).

**Task Wrapper**: `Handlers` are then wrapped in a `Task Wrapper` that provide gym-style APIs to users. Each task wrapper corresponds to a task. A task wrapper is shipped with a default `Scenario Config`, which defines the static scene of the task. Other features realted to the task, including reward function and success reporting, are explicitely implemented in this wrapper for each task.

**Domain Randomizer**: `Domain Randomizer` will be responsible for both static randomizations (object mass, friction, lightings) at reset of the simulation (similar to what you can do in Isaaclab), as well as real-time randomizations that randomizes the observations and actions for each step. The randomizer will wrap the `Task Wrapper` to form a randomized task.

All these modules are organized as follows in our repository:

## Module Description

### 1. **metasim - Core Simulation Framework**

Metasim is the core layer of RoboVerse, responsible for providing unified abstractions across different simulators and managing simulation states. Its goal is to shield upper layers from simulator-specific differences and expose a consistent state interface.

* **sim/**: Provides a unified abstraction layer for 11 simulators. Each simulator defines a handler (e.g., `MJXHandler`, `IsaacHandler`) that inherits from `BaseSimHandler` and is responsible for:

  * Loading assets
  * Physics stepping
  * Setting/resetting environment states
  * Extracting structured states for upper layers

* **task/**: Defines standardized task interfaces, enabling quick migration and extension of tasks.

* **scenario/**: Scenario configuration and management. These provide the complete set of static information required by a handler for initialization and launch, including robots, scenes, cameras, and lighting.

* **utils/**: Utility library covering cameras, kinematics, teleoperation, and more.

* **queries/**: Unified query interface for accessing simulation states and environment information.

* **example/**: Example and tutorial code.

* **tests/**: Unit and integration tests ensuring system stability.

---

### 2. **roboverse_learn - Machine Learning Module**

RoboVerse Learn focuses on implementing and integrating learning algorithms:

* **il/**: Imitation learning algorithms.
* **rl/**: Reinforcement learning algorithms.

This module provides **adapters for third-party algorithms**, as well as **in-house implementations**, and comes with **standardized training scripts**. All algorithms interact with **Metasim Tasks** via a unified interface, enabling plug-and-play learning workflows.

---

### 3. **roboverse_pack - Preconfigured Packages**

* **robots/**: Predefined robot models.
* **scenes/**: Standardized simulation scenes.
* **tasks/**: Predefined task environments.

---

### 4. **get_started - Quick Start**

* **motion_planning/**: Motion planning examples.
* **rl/**: Reinforcement learning examples.
* **dexhands/**: Dexterous hand control examples.

### 5. **scripts - Utility Scripts**

* **conversion/**: File and format conversion utilities.
* **advanced/**: Advanced features and extension scripts.
* **statistics/**: Data collection and statistical analysis tools.
* **mesh_tools/**: 3D mesh processing tools.

---

## Summary

The RoboVerse architecture emphasizes modularity and decoupling:

* **Metasim**: Unified simulation interface and scenario management.
* **RoboVerse Learn**: Algorithm adapters, implementations, and standardized training scripts.
* **RoboVerse Pack**: Out-of-the-box robot, scene, and task configurations.
* **Get Started**: Quick-start examples for fast adoption.
* **Scripts**: Supporting utilities and advanced tools.
